# Hex Decoder

This simple WinForms application will convert REG_BINARY, REG_MULTI_SZ and REG_EXPAND_SZ registry values to a friendly string. The tool supports multiple encoding including UTF-16, ASCII and Latin1. An additional option is provided for the S256H value which will return the SHA256 Base64 hash of the corresponding uncompressed .manifest file.
